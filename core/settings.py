"""Centralized runtime configuration, backed by pydantic-settings.

Every environment variable the pipeline reads is declared here once, with
its type and default, instead of being scattered as ad-hoc os.environ.get()
calls across a dozen modules. Env vars are matched case-insensitively
(KS_PATH, ks_path, Ks_Path all bind to `ks_path`), so every existing GitHub
Actions secret/env name keeps working unchanged.

One shared `settings` singleton is imported by both the core/ library code
and the top-level scripts (main.py, finalize_release.py, prepare_release.py,
commit_signature.py) - and those scripts each only need a subset of these
fields, so nothing here is a required field. Anything that's truly required
for a given entrypoint (e.g. RELEASE_TAG for finalize_release.py) is checked
explicitly at the point of use instead, the same way the original code did
with plain os.environ lookups.
