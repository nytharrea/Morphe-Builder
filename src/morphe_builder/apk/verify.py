"""APK signing-certificate verification.

Pins each app to a known-good certificate SHA-256 fingerprint (recorded in
signatures/known_signatures.json) and refuses to continue if a freshly downloaded
APK's certificate doesn't match that pin - this is what stops a
compromised/rogue mirror from ever reaching the patch step undetected.

Why androguard *and* cryptography, not one or the other: the hard part of
this problem is locating and extracting the signer certificate(s) from the
APK's v1/v2/v3 signing block(s), which is an Android-specific binary
container format - that's what androguard understands. What comes back is
then just an X.509 certificate, and hashing its DER encoding is
cryptography's job. androguard actually already depends on and uses
cryptography for that half internally, so using both together (rather than
reimplementing APK signing-block parsing by hand on top of cryptography
alone) is the natural fit, not a compromise between the two options.

androguard's own certificate return type has changed across major versions
(asn1crypto objects, then pyasn1, now cryptography.x509.Certificate) -
`_cert_der_bytes` normalizes whatever comes back down to raw DER bytes
before hashing, rather than depending on a specific attribute name, so this
keeps working across androguard upgrades.
